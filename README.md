# TEST (ANITAPF)

## About
The very first game I tried to make was a text-adventure game written in Batch, of all things. I still go back and play from time to time, to be honest, but the code is so ... ughk, that I've largely abandon it.

## How To Play
Getting the game into a play state is a little tricky for the uninitiated. Here's how to do it:<br>
1. Download/Pull the 'Anatapf' Folder 
2. Open a Windows command prompt in the 'Anatapf' directory
3. In the command prompt, enter: '@echo off' and then 'cls'
4. Now type in 'restart' to start playing!

**Note:** The game is not finished; also there are plenty of bugs so be prepared to repeat the above process rather often.
