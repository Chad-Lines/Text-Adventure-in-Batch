#TEST (ANITAPF)

##About
The very first game I tried to make was a text-adventure game written in Batch, of all things. I still go back and play from time to time, to be honest, but the code is so ... ughk, that I've largely abandon it. <br>

## How To Play
Getting the game into a play state is a little tricky for the uninitiated. Here's how to do it:<br>
1. Download/Pull the 'Anatapf' Folder <br>
2. Open a Windows ommand prompt in the 'Anatapf' directory<br>
3. In the command prompt, enter: '@echo off' and then 'cls'<br>
4. Now type in 'restart' to start playing!<br>
<br>
**Note:** The game is not finished; also there are plenty of bugs so be prepared to repeat the above process rather often.
